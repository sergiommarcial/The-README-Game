#### START
<pre>
Once upon a time in the bustling city of Binaryville, there lived a brilliant 
software engineer named Alex.

One day, an urgent message arrived in Binaryville. The city's central computer, 
which controlled everything from traffic lights to financial transactions, 
had been infected by a mysterious and malicious virus. The entire city was in chaos 
as systems malfunctioned and communication broke down.
