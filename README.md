Once upon a time in the bustling city of Binaryville, there lived a brilliant software engineer named Alex. Alex was known throughout the city for their innovative coding skills and their ability to solve complex programming puzzles. They had a natural talent for creating elegant and efficient algorithms that left their peers in awe.

One day, an urgent message arrived in Binaryville. The city's central computer, which controlled everything from traffic lights to financial transactions, had been infected by a mysterious and malicious virus. The entire city was in chaos as systems malfunctioned and communication broke down.
